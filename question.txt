Assignment: Student Management System

You are tasked with creating a student management system using object-oriented programming in Python. This system should allow you to perform the following operations:

Create a student class with attributes such as name, roll number, age, and a list of courses they are enrolled in.

Create a course class with attributes like course name, course code, and a list of students enrolled in the course.

Implement methods to:

Add a new student to the system.
Add a new course to the system.
Enroll a student in a course.
View the list of students in a particular course.
View the list of courses a student is enrolled in.
Calculate the average age of students in a course.
Use NumPy or Pandas to perform statistical analysis on the data. For example, you can use NumPy to calculate the mean age of all students, or Pandas to create a DataFrame to organize and display student/course data.

Implement error handling to deal with scenarios such as enrolling a student in a non-existent course or adding a student without necessary information.

Create a menu-driven program that allows users to interact with the student management system, such as adding students, adding courses, enrolling students, and displaying information.

Provide a user-friendly interface and clear prompts for the user's input.

Note: You can use NumPy for numerical operations (e.g., calculating average age) and Pandas for data organization and manipulation (e.g., creating DataFrames to store student/course data).

Ensure that your program is well-documented with comments and includes a README file that explains how to run the program and provides examples of its usage.

This assignment will give you a chance to practice object-oriented programming, handle data using NumPy and Pandas, and create a functional program for managing students and courses.
